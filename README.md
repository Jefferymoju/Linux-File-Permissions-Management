### Linux File Permissions Management

**Objective / Overview:**  
This project demonstrates my experience using Linux commands to examine and manage file permissions. The focus was on ensuring that files and directories within the projects folder had correct permissions, matching the organizationâ€™s intended access levels. Actions included reviewing file permissions, modifying permissions for specific users and groups, and securing hidden files and directories.

**Skills Learned:**  
- Understanding Linux file and directory permissions.  
- Using `ls -l` and `ls -la` to inspect permissions.  
- Applying `chmod` commands to modify read, write, and execute permissions for users, groups, and others.  
- Managing hidden files and directories securely.  
- Critical thinking in implementing security policies on file systems.  

**Tools / Methods Used:**  
- Linux terminal / Bash shell.  
- Commands: `ls -l`, `ls -la`, `cd`, `chmod`.  
- File system structure review and permission auditing.  

**Deliverables / Files:**  
- Full documentation of the project in a Word document: [View Full Documentation](doc/File_permissions_in_Linux.pdf)
